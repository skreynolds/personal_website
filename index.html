  <b>Bio</b>. I am currently focused on completing my honors thesis. I'm keen to explore ideas around the use of a neural network architectures employed to control the bipedal locomotion models. This is the final requirement for the completion of a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical) at Charles Darwin University (CDU). In early 2017, I was a working as a Systems Engineer at <a href="https://www.rockwellcollins.com/Worldwide/Australia/Australia.aspx" target="_blank">Rockwell Collins</a>, in Sydney, as part of the Defence Engineering Internship Program. During my time at Rockwell, I contributed to the developing a message protocol for a <a href="./personal_website_static/idvs_data_sheet.pdf">helmet mounted augmented reality device</a>. I also managed to squeeze in another internship during early 2016 with Aurecon, in Singapore, after winning a New Columbo Scholarship offered by CDU. During this time I worked in the Building Services discipline modelling small to medium dwellings using Revit. Prior to commencing my studies at CDU I was awarded my Bachelor of Mathematical Science from The University of Adelaide in 2013, majoring in Applied Mathematics. My studies focused on modelling Stochasitic systems using discrete and continuous time Markovian Processes. In another life, I worked as a Financial Accountant after receiving my Bachelor of Finance from The University of Adelaide.

  On the side (for fun) I operate a website called <a href="http://nexusedx.com" target="_blank">Nexus EdX</a>. It's an educational platform which runs on the Open EdX source code, and is dedicated to helping others learn Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In 2017 CDU sought to leverage the knowledge that I had developed over this time and employed me to develop an experimental eLearning platform based on the Open EdX source code, called <a href="https://cdux.cdu.edu.au" target="_blank">CDUX</a>.

    	I've been forever obsessed with creating a map of the knowledge of all the subjects I've studied - which is quite a bit...I've probably overcapitalised. Anyway, here is most of it. The red dots are projects. Other colours are subjects. Click on stuff.

        I love teaching. I was a bit sad when I hung up my High School teaching hat so I could follow my other passions (e.g. robots). I run this site, <a href="https://nexusedx.com" target="_blank">Nexus EdX</a>, which gives me some capacity to get my chalk and talk happening once more. The platform runs on the open source code which powers EdX, and offers a selection of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics subjects. The course content is made up of short 10 minute videos, which are punctuated by exercises to help learners solidify their understanding. The cost to use the site is $40 per subject per semester, but if you want to view the videos for free, I have them listed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3k3SS9nw0cRGQ_FAabBtJg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
